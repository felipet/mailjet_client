//! A client for [Mailjet's API][mapi] using [reqwest][reqwest] and [tracing][tracing].
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! This library crate includes an implementation written in Rust for a client of Mailjet's API. As of today, there
//! is no official Rust client released by the company behind Mailjet. Though there exist a few Rust
//! clients out in [](crates.io), none of them include some of the features that I needed, so here it goes another
//! client implementation in Rust!
//!
//! ## Main Features
//!
//! - **Tracing support via [Tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing)**: the library code includes tracing calls
//!   using `Tracing`'s API.
//! - **Usage of [Reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) as internal HTTP client**: `Reqwest` is my crate of
//!   choice for this use-case scenarios. The crate `Reqwest-tracing` is also addedd to enable tracing support for
//!   the internal HTTP client.
//! - **High level of test coverage** and support for CI. Given that I aim to include this crate into another service
//!   that needs a high level of reliavility, not including a proper set of tests was a non-go.
//!
//! ## Caveats
//! Offering a full client implementation is not my initial plan, so **don't expect a full 1:1 Rust implementation of
//! the existing API** clients provided by Mailjet. This project is open-sourced, so if you need to cover some
//! missing endpoint of Mailjet's API, feel free to open a new Issue describing your needs. Either if you plan to
//! develop it by yourself, or you need somebody else to do it, it will be good to know that there's interest on
//! adding such missing feature to the client.

/// This module includes all the object definitions need to interact with Mailjet's API.
///
/// # Description
///
/// The objects defined in the REST [API][mapi] are directly traslated into Rust's types using naming conventions of
/// Rust (snake case for `struct`'s members). Be aware of that, because some names in the objects defined in the REST
/// API don't follow any known convention. _PascalCase_ seems to be the usual choice for them, but some object's
/// atributes get akward names such as ***DnsID***. The objects defined here in strictly follow the snake case naming
/// rules, and `serde`'s macros are used to rename the fields (see [this](https://serde.rs/field-attrs.html#rename)).
///
/// # Mailjet REST API responses
///
/// All the responses of the API are defined this way:
/// - A status code, which stems from regular HTTP response codes, to indicate the success or failure of an API
///   request. From their API docs:
///
/// ```verbatim
/// Overall:
/// - Codes in the 2xx range indicate that the request was processed successfully.
/// - Codes in the 4xx range indicate that there was an error with the request (e.g. unauthorized access, a
///   required parameter is missing etc.).
/// - Codes in the 5xx range indicate that there is an issue with Mailjet's servers. Those are quite rare.
/// ```
///
///   Check out their [docs](https://dev.mailjet.com/email/reference/overview/errors/) to read a full explanation
///   of each status or error code.
/// - An array of objects. Each endpoint of the REST API defines a different response object.
/// - A couple of integers to inform about the amount of matches that the query generated, and the amount of items
///   returned in the response. This is useful for queries that generate high number of matches (hundreds), and
///   need pagination. However, this is gently opaqued from the implementation of this client of the API, so any
///   user needs to worry about it. **A client's call will return all the matches at once.**
///
/// Only the two first items of the list are included in the response objects returned by this client. To cope
/// with the problem of a non-homogeneous response data object definition, the trait [ResponseObject] is defined
/// in this crate. This way, a common type [crate::data_objects::Response] is returned by every call of the client
/// that wraps a GET method of the REST API.
///
/// [mapi]: https://dev.mailjet.com/email/reference/overview/

    /// An alias to ease developers difficult lives: a [Vec] of objects that implement [ResponseObject].

    /// Common response type for GET methods of Mailjet's API.
    ///
    /// # Description
    ///
    /// This object encapsulates the response of any endpoint of Mailjet's API. If [Response::status_code] is a
    /// success code, the payload will be populated with a particular response object (depends on the used endpoint).
    ///
    /// The [Response::payload] includes the response data from the API. The following list matches APIs's objects
    /// returned as responses and the data objects defined by this crate:
    /// - `/sender (GET)` -> [crate::data_objects::responses::Sender]
